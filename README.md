# jon_duckett_web_development

These files are all exercises from Jon Duckett's Javascript & jQuery Interactive Front-end Web Development Book.
All code is uploaded here as practice in writing his code.

All credit goes to Jon Duckett and his teachings work from his book and website "@ht
tp://javascriptbook.com/"

I will be working on a different repository to show examples of my own work to showcase what I have learned from his book
